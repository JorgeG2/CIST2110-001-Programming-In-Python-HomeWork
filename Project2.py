# Project 2
# Name:
# Project 2 will test on topics learned in class so far. You will be creating a contact list program with an external csv file that will store the contacts. The program will have the following features:
# 1. Add contact
# 2. View contacts
# 3. Delete contact
# 4. Save contacts to csv file
# 5. Next Birthday
# 0. Quit

# Import the csv module, datetime module
import csv
import datetime as dt

# Make sure to show docs strings for each function and include comments in your code. Make sure to include a main function and call the main function at the end of the program.

print("Welcome to the Contact List Program")

# There is also a contact.csv file that will be used to store the contacts. The csv file will have the following format:
# Name,Phone,Email,Birthday
# The program will be menu driven and will display the menu as shown above. The program will run until the user selects option 0 to quit. The program will be implemented in a file called Project2.py. The program will use the following functions:


# import_csv - This function will import the contacts from the csv file. The function will return a dictionary of contacts. The key will be the name of the contact and the value will be a dictionary containing the phone number, email address, and birthday. The function will take one parameter, the name of the csv file. The function will display an error message if the file does not exist. The function will display a message if the file exists and the contacts were imported successfully.
# Hint1: Use the csv module to read the csv file. Use the csv.reader function. IE. reader = csv.reader(file)
# Hint2: You will need to skip the first line of the csv file since it contains the column headers. You can do that with the next function. IE. next(reader)
# Hint3: You will need to create a dictionary of contacts. You can do that by looping through the reader object. IE. for row in reader:
# Hint4: You will need to convert the birthday to a datetime object. You can do that by using the strptime function. IE. dt.datetime.strptime(row[3], '%m/%d/%Y')
# Hint5: You will need to create a dictionary of the phone number, email address, and birthday. You can do that by creating a dictionary and adding the values to the dictionary. IE. contact[row[0]] = {'Phone': row[1], 'Email': row[2], 'Birthday': dt.datetime.strptime(row[3], '%m/%d/%Y')}
# Hint6: Use the FileNotFoundError exception to catch if the file does not exist.
